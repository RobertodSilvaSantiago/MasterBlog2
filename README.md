Flask application that implements a basic blog system. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Imports necessary modules: The code imports the Flask, render_template, request, and redirect modules from the Flask framework, as well as the json module for working with JSON data.

Creates a Flask application: An instance of the Flask class is created, representing the Flask application. The __name__ argument is passed to indicate the module's name.

Defines utility functions:

get_data_from_json(): Reads data from a JSON file (data.json) and returns it as a dictionary.
save_data_to_json(data): Saves a dictionary to the JSON file (data.json).
fetch_post_by_id(id_, blog_posts): Searches for a post with a specific ID in a list of blog posts and returns the post if found.
add_or_update_post(post_id, form_dict, blog_posts): Adds a new post or updates an existing post based on the provided ID and form data. The updated data is then saved to the JSON file.
Defines routes and corresponding view functions:

'/' (index): Renders the homepage (index.html) and retrieves the blog posts from the JSON file.
'/add' (add): Handles both GET and POST requests. If the method is GET, it renders the form to add a new post. If the method is POST, it adds the submitted post to the JSON file and redirects back to the homepage.
'/delete/<int:post_id>' (delete): Deletes a post with a specific ID from the JSON file and redirects back to the homepage.
'/update/<int:post_id>' (update): Handles both GET and POST requests. If the method is GET, it renders the form to update an existing post with the current post data. If the method is POST, it updates the post with the submitted form data in the JSON file and redirects back to the homepage.
'/like/<int:post_id>' (like): Increments the number of likes for a post with a specific ID in the JSON file and redirects back to the homepage.
Launches the Flask development server: The __name__ variable is checked, and if it equals "__main__", the Flask development server is launched with the specified host, port, and debug mode.

The code combines Flask routing, JSON data handling, and rendering HTML templates to create a basic blog application where users can add, update, delete, and like blog posts.
